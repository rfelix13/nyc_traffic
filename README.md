 This is a data analysis project on the taxi data that is enclosed in the Data folder. 
 The analysis attempts to answer the following questions:
 
1. What one-hour window in January 2018 (e.g. 3-4AM on January 22) saw the highest number of taxi pickups?

2. Accordingto www.nyc.gov, the meter(fare_amount)is calculated using a $2.50 base fare plus $0.50 per 1/5 mile when traveling above 12mph or per 60 seconds in slow traffic or when the vehicle is stopped. Use this information to build a model that predicts fare_amount as a function of trip duration and distance. Were you able to successfully reverse engineer the fare rules?

3. What are some features of rides that yield very generous (not just large) tips?

4. Produce a visualization that shows how demand for taxis depends on both the time of day and day of the week (for reference, January 1, 2018 was a Monday). The goal of this visualization should be to clearly highlight periods of high/low demand (e.g. rush hour), as well as any interesting patterns or trends that emerge for different days of the week.

5. Construct a probabilistic model to predict the drop-off borough given the pickup borough, time of day, and day of week. Using this model, what is your estimate of the probability that a passenger is dropped off in Queens given she's picked up in Manhattan at 10:12 AM on a Tuesday?

6. Construct and justify a set hypotheses as to how the trip observations would be affected by inclement weather, such as rain or snow. Based on your hypotheses, identify the one-hour window in this data set in which you are most confident that bad weather occurred.
